![Schermata 2023-04-25 alle 10 01 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91114037/234221834-8bc14c77-fc11-4cc8-a10d-853c1c05b71a.png)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the FakeStore Management web app, a project created as part of the FrontEnd course at Start2Impact. This React-based web app simulates a management system for managing products in an online store.

## Project Overview!


The web app allows users to log in using the following credentials:
```
Email: eve.holt@reqres.in
Password: cityslicka
```
These credentials rely on the API provided by [Reqres](https://reqres.in/api/login). The rest of the application is built using the  [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs).

Users can perform various operations, such as adding, editing, and deleting products. Although these operations will trigger a success message if the server call is successful, they will not affect the actual database. To inform users about this behavior, alert messages are displayed confirming the changes made to the product.

## Resposnive Design

The application is fully responsive and adapts well to mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes and platforms.
 
## Testing the App

To test the app, please visit: [https://fakestoremanagement.netlify.app/](https://fakestoremanagement.netlify.app/)



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
